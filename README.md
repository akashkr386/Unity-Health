# 🏥 Unity Health

**Unity Health** is a robust full-stack web application built to streamline the process of scheduling medical appointments. Designed with scalability, role-based access, and real-world healthcare workflows in mind, it caters to three distinct user groups — Patients, Doctors, and Administrators — each with tailored interfaces and functionality.

---

### 🔍 Objective
The main goal of Unity Health is to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare professionals by providing a unified platform that ensures real-time appointment availability, organized scheduling, and efficient communication. Whether it's a general consultation, dermatological issue, gynecological concern, or neurological diagnosis — patients can connect with certified specialists without the usual hassle.
